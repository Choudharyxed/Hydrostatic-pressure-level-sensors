## Introduction

This project is a demonstration of serverless computing and submitted as a project for subect of Serverless Computing fir IoT.

The main idea is to mimic a **hydeostatic pressure level senor** placed inside a water tank which will **alert** the user when the level on the water inside the tank is **low**.\
The notification is generated by the **Telegram bot**. The user, when notified, have to select the most suitable option from the below options presented to them with notification via Telegram bot. This options are as under:

- Turn on water pump.
- Warn someone to turn on the water pump.
- Ignore the alert.

## Architecture

The main phase of the project is to mimic the sending of the data by a hydrostatic pressure level sensor  as there is no real sensor available in this project.

In this project, the sending data can be done by two applications:

- By creating a function on **Nuclio**;
- By using a MQTT client application on a
